# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be a professional. Treat people the way you'd want to be treated at work. Don't be a jerk.

---

## The Longer Version

### Who This Applies To

Everyone who participates in the lazy.go project: contributors, maintainers, people opening issues, people posting in discussions. If you're interacting with this project in any capacity, this applies to you.

### What's Expected

- **Be direct without being cruel.** Honest technical criticism is valuable. Personal attacks are not. There's a difference between "this approach has a performance problem at scale" and "this is stupid."
- **Disagree on the code, not the person.** Technical disagreements are healthy. Debates about someone's competence, background, or identity are not.
- **Pull your weight.** If you're going to report a bug, reproduce it. If you're going to request a feature, explain the problem it solves. If you get feedback on a PR, engage with it.
- **Accept "no".** Not every idea belongs in this project. A rejection is not an attack.

### What's Not Tolerated

- Harassment of any kind, public or private
- Discriminatory language or behaviour — race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, nationality, none of it
- Deliberate intimidation or threats
- Sustained disruption of discussions
- Publishing private information without consent

### If Something Goes Wrong

If someone is behaving badly, contact the maintainer directly. Reports are handled privately and seriously.

Maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions, comments, or issues from anyone who violates this code, without obligation to explain why.
